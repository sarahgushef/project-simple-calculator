#Simple Javascript Calculator

This code is from:

- https://freshman.tech/calculator/
- https://freshman.tech/css-grid-calculator/

But I modify the html, and css a little bit.
Maybe next time, I'll add some features, so I can modify the JS :). I still learn the logic how to make a calculator, don't judge me, pls :)
